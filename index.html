        <p>
          Woody and the gang go on a road trip with new toy Forky, who's
          convinced he's trash and doesn't yet understand his role in the world.
          Along the way, Woody is unexpectedly reunited with independent spirit
          Bo Peep and finds himself faced with a decision, and a future, he
          never imagined.

                He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a boy
                named Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten, Woody
                served as the leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by
                looking out for each member of the group. When Andy enters
                adulthood and leaves for college, Woody is donated to a little
                girl named Bonnie Anderson. He remains with Bonnie for some
                time, before choosing to become an owner-less antique devoted to
                helping lost toys find owners, alongside his girlfriend Bo Peep.

                He is a spaceman action figure originally belonging to Andy
                Davis. Buzz was created during a time where astronauts were
                especially popular amongst children. His arrival in the original
                Toy Story created conflict with Andy's favorite toy Sheriff
                Woody, though this rivalry would eventually blossom into a
                lifelong friendship.

                An actual spork-turned-craft-project, Forky is pretty sure that
                he doesn’t belong in Bonnie's room. Unfortunately, every time he
                tries to get away, Woody yanks him back into an adventure he’d
                rather skip. Forky is a toy that Bonnie made out of a disposable
                spork, so he’s facing a crisis. He wants to fulfill his purpose
                as a spork, but now has a new toy purpose thrust upon him.”

                Bo is the romantic interest (later girlfriend) of Woody,
                providing a calm and loving comfort whenever he is overwhelmed.
                She is noted for using her shepherdess crook to hook her cowboy
                and bring him closer in a romantic way. In private, she is a
                great deal more daring with her words and actions, which Woody
                seems to be quite fond of. She and her sheep were bought along
                with the lamp not too long after Molly was born, due to the baby
                being scared of the dark, which "broke every toy's heart",
                according to Woody. The lamp comforted Molly and she would often
                have her hand lay on Bo's feet.
